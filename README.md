# TLQ-pipeline
TLQ pipeline is similar to an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipeline, except that  Transform phase (Service #1) additionally incorporates the extract. Service #1 performs E and T, service #2 performs L, and Service #3 performs Q. The “E” has been simplified because input data is provided in a single easy-to-use format.
